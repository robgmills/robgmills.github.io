I reluctantly made the jump from an individual contributor to management only a few years ago.
When I did, I despised the thought that I would be forced to become [pointy haired][point-haired-boss] and "tech-less".
But isn't that what all managers do?  
Loose their hard skills in favor (hopefully) of gaining soft skills?
Instead, I took a different direction.  
Why did I have to choose?  

Today, being a technical manager has made me more successful than I thought I could be.
I've come to pride myself on being able to grok a conversation amongst the brightest engineering team I've ever worked with without slowing them down.
This has enabled me to trust my teams.
Because I can understand their implementation details, I can spot gaps, suggest alternative approaches, and more clearly lay out what our goals are.

In return, it's earned me respect.
My teams know they can come to me to help them through a problem - by pairing, whiteboarding or doing my own R&D or POCs.
Engineers on other teams fight over the chance to work with me and consistently seek me out for technical advice - even over their own managers.
My superiors know that I am someone who can unify technical concepts to business objectives and vet out experienced engineers.

But it's not all silver-lining.
There's a cloud in there somewhere.
I miss building stuff that a wider set of people use.
I miss being able to objectively measure the value that I provide a company.
I miss practicing a craft.
