The developers at Flickr should know better than that.  There's no need to actually purge/delete the potentially copyright offending work and associated content.  A simple flag that designates whether or not the content can be shown is all you need.  That way in the event of a false DMCA claim like this, its easy to completely restore the value of the original posting.  

Here's hoping that the Internet mob gets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Gorman" title="Dave Gorman" target="_blank">Dave Gorman</a> a little justice.  I'd expect Flickr to quickly implement a fix <em>AND</em> find a way to restore his lost data soon.
