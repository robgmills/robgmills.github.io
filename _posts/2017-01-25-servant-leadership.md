> The highest type of ruler is one of whose existence the people are barely aware.
> Next comes one whom they love and praise.
> Next comes one whom they fear.
> Next comes one whom they despise and defy.
> 
> When you are lacking in faith,
> Others will be unfaithful to you.
> 
> The Sage is self-effacing and scanty of words.
> When his task is accomplished and things have been completed, All the people say, ‘We ourselves have achieved it!’
