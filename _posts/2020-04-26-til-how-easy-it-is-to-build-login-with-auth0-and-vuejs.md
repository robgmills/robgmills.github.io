Today (and yesterday), I ran through the Auth0 quickstart for building a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) single-page application with login and secured HTTP REST calls to an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) API.
I learned how developer-friendly Auth0 and Vue.js are.
You can find [my version of the Auth0 tutorial in GitHub](https://github.com/robgmills/auth0-vuejs-tutorial) with a few minor tweaks to the official one.
I think I'll continue building things out in this stack!
Even though I know this probably isn't the most efficient stack, I like how easy it is to transition between front- and back-end - especially for toy projects.
