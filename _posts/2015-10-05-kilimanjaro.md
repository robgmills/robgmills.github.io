![TL;DR - WE MADE IT!!!](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0448.JPG)

> What were we thinking?

That's what I kept asking myself on the flight to Tanzania to start our honeymoon.  Most people choose to park their 
asses at a Sandals resort for a week - sipping Pina Coladas on a beach.  But my new wife, she decided to follow up our 
wedding with one of the most physically _and_ mentally demanding challenges of our lives. This was either going to 
be one of those things that somehow brought us even closer together than ever before (which would be saying something
given the wedding high we were still riding), or forebode a tumultuous lifelong commitment.  

We opted for the longer, 7-day (5.5 days up, 1.5 days down) [Rongai route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro_climbing_routes#Rongai_Route).
[Team Kilimanjaro](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/), the outfit we climbed with, has [their own variation on the Rongai 
route](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/rongai/) that employs a combination of the traditional Rongai route and the [Northern
Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro_climbing_routes#Northern_Circuit) and offers a better 88% 
success rate due to better altitude acclimation than the approximately 50% success rate of the most popular (and 
therefore most crowded) [Marangu route](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/marangu/).  The added advantages ended up being
that we saw a lot more of the mountain, enjoyed far more picturesque hikes during the day (we took the Marangu route 
on the way down and could directly compare), and encountered far fewer other hikers.
 
Our crew consisted of 2 guides, 2 cooks, and 6 porters.  They were impeccable.  The team seemed younger, happier, and
more fun than the other teams we ran into.  In addition, it seemed like all of the other climbing teams knew them. That
had to be a good sign.

##Day 1
We were met at our hotel, [Onsea House](http://www.onseahouse.com/) in the nearby town of Arusha, by our head guide, 
Thomas Jonas, at 0730 to do the pre-climb gear check and run-through.  My gear list consisted of the following:

* North Face Triclimate jacket with fleece liner (Wish I had a more substantial down or Thermoball liner).
* [Patagonia Better Sweater jacket](http://amzn.to/1PkHtcS)
* [Prana Zion pants](http://amzn.to/1GHAliM)
* [People Socks wool socks](http://amzn.to/1GHAORY) (packed 5 pairs, only needed 3)
* [Fox River liner socks](http://amzn.to/1OwxVvb) (2 pairs - one pair to just wear around camp to help dry my feet 
and let them breathe and one pair to wear on ascent day as an extra layer; also, better to have an not need, than 
need an not have)
* [Under Armour Tech t-shirts](http://amzn.to/1Phd5jM) (2)
* [Ex Officio briefs and boxers](http://amzn.to/1VT19Uc) (packed 4 pairs, only needed 2)
* Light weight base layer (wish I had heavy wool base layers)
* [Patagonia Torrentshell rain jacket](http://amzn.to/1OwytRX)
* Ski/snowboard pants (to double as waterproof pants)
* Ski gloves (wish I had warmer gloves)
* [North Face Salty Dog beanie](http://amzn.to/1PheHKi)
* Balaclava
* Nike sweat pants (to sleep in and that I probably should have worn under my hiking pants on ascent day)
* [Ray-Ban Original Wayfarer sunglasses (non-polarized)](http://amzn.to/1QtYX3S) (with [Croakies eyewear retainer]
(http://amzn.to/1K9R8Lm))
* [Buff headwear](http://amzn.to/1K9RmST)
* [Camelbak Military Water Beast Omega 3L reservoir (w/insulated tube)](http://amzn.to/1Qu0qHA)
* [Nalgene 1QT water bottle](http://amzn.to/1K9SeqJ)

* Deodorant
* Toothpaste
* Sunscreen
* Lip balm
* Toilet paper (stolen from hotel room the night before)
* Snacks (chocolates, dried mango and cherries, nuts, [Quest protien bars](http://amzn.to/1NHWzsP))
* [Hydration powder](http://amzn.to/1Qu1lHZ)
* 0&deg;C-rated sleeping bag (rented from TK)
* [Waterproof duffel bag](http://amzn.to/1Qu1RWD) (rented from TK)
* Kindle
* 100% Plastic playing cards
* Headlamp
* Backpacking lantern/flashlight
* Diamox
* Malaria pills
* Bandaids for blisters
* Ibuprofen
* Trekking poles (rented from TK)

We took a nearly 3 hour bus ride to Moshi, the town closest to Kilimanjaro, so the team could stock up on food 
supplies.  We took the opportunity to buy some J&J baby powder (which we ended up not using at all) and some bug 
repellent (which we ended up needing for safari, but not on the mountain).  We got ripped off at the store on the 
exchange rate on the deal - an expensive lesson that I seem to need reminding of on every trip.  We then needed to 
stop at Marangu gate so our guides could get the proper permits.  Things still hadn't sunk in.

![At Marangu Gate - look how fresh we are!](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0277.JPG)

We hopped back in the van with the team and proceeded to Rongai Gate.  Another couple (they were speaking french, so I 
dubbed them "French Couple" in my head) and their team was making final preparations to set off on the first part of 
their journey.  Our team made and served us lunch before we followed.

![Lunch at Rongai Gate](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0282.JPG)

Since we started after mid-day, we only had time for a short 3-hour hike to Simba Camp (2,650 m/8,690 ft).  On
the way, we passed through plantations, a man-made forest used to supply local craftsmen with lumber for furniture and 
construction, and a mountain rain-forest where we saw Colobus monkeys in the trees. By the time we reach Simba 
Camp, the sun has set and camp has already been prepared by the porters.

![Setting off from Rongai Gate](/images/kilimanjaro/20150930060425.jpg)

*[TK Update:](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-1a/)* We are at Rongai 
Gate, starting point of our trek and both climbers feel great and excited. Day 1 of our trek and we are heading to Sekimba camp today for overnight sleep.

##Day 2
I always wake up early while camping - Day 2 was no exception.  I figure I'll try to do some more reading, but find 
that my Kindle is dead.  _WTF._  It's completely unresponsive.  This is going to be a boring week.

![Early view on Day 2 hike](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0295.JPG)

Our Day 2 hike promises to be the longest of the climb in terms of total distance covered on our upward journey.  We 
pass out of the forest and into moorland.  About an hour into the hike, Mrs complains of nausea.  Her hypochondria 
kicks in and she starts getting nervous.

At this point, it's important that I mention our mindset.  We're keenly aware of the [perils of climbing to great 
altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness).  Symptoms include headache, acting drunk, slurring words, the inability to 
walk a straight line, difficulty breathing or catching one's breath at rest and, of course, _nausea_.  The most 
important way to battle altitude sicknesses of all types is to stay hydrated.  That's why we're each carrying 
3-liters of water in our Camelbaks.

So Mrs is nervous.  She's worried she's got altitude sickness.  So she starts drinking a lot of water hoping that it 
makes the nausea go away.  I'm used to drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated.  Mrs is not.  Her daily intake of 
water has not prepared her to handle drinking nearly 2-liters of water in 1.5 hours.  A quick boot-n-rally is in 
order, and she soldiers on to lunch at Second Cave Camp (3,450 m/11,320 ft) where she sneaks in a quick nap.  I've 
got to hand it to her, she's a tough one.

![Nap time](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0314.JPG)
 
We hike on after lunch, continuing to Kikelewa Camp at the edge of the moorland.  When we get to camp, we see the 
French Couple's camp already set, and a new team has joined.  Dinner includes french fries, which makes Mrs really 
happy.

*[TK Update](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-2a/):* Day 2 of our trek 
and we are heading to Kikelewa Camp from Sekimba Camp with a nice weather on our side. Both climbers are doing very 
well.

##Day 3
Wake up feeling a little sore, but that's to be expected.  We're the second ones out of camp behind the French Couple
and ahead of the new, bigger group who's still tearing down their camp.

![View of our destination from Kikelewa Camp in the morning](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0340.JPG)

Where Day 2 challenged in terms of distance covered, Day 3 threatens us with a steep vertical scamper to the next 
camp.  We arrive to Tarn Hut (4600m) at the base of Mawenzi, the second highest peak on Kilimanjaro by lunch.

![Sign (and bones) at Tarn Hut](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0403.JPG)

Mawenzi is visually enthralling.  It, like the main peak - Kibo, was formed by a volcano.  Unlike Kibo, Mawenzi 
violently exploded leaving it jagged and intimidating.  Tarn Hut is located on at the top of a steep drop off on the 
side of the peak that was blown out by the explosion, offering great views into the remnants of the crater and peak. 
There's a bones, large and small, along the camp site floor and there's two horns from a cow or buffalo on the sign 
for the camp.  I didn't think large animals made it up this far.  Weird.

![On the way to Mawenzi](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0379.JPG)

We're scheduled for an acclimation hike in the afternoon that gets delayed to to hail.  Once we do set off, we head 
up a ridge around the Mowenzi crater.  We reach a peak altitude of 4700m, well beyond the maximum altitude for all 
but the heartiest vegetation leaving mostly volcanic rocks and dust.  At this point, I'm in awe of the most 
breathtaking views both a billowing fog and cloud wrapped Mawenzi, and a distant, sunny Kibo and realize I'm in for a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

![Looking down on Tarn Hut during the acclimation hike](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0436.JPG)

It's freezing cold at night.  I have trouble sleeping.  This should be a warning sign.  I get up in the middle of the
night to poop (Finally! The first time this hike!) and am afforded more breathtaking views of Mowiake lit up by the 
moon under a clear, majestic night sky that I've never seen before.  Tanzania is the furthest south I've ever 
visited and offers mostly unfamiliar constellations.

![Toilets with a view](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0439.JPG)

*[TK Update](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-3a/):* Both climbers woke
up great at Kikelewa Camp and we are now on the way to Mawenzi Tarn hut with a nice weather on our side, good for 
hiking.

##Day 4
Again, I wake up early.  I have to pee from spending the night shivering and drinking water.  And again, I am treated
to more amazing views - this time of the sun rising over the clouds below the edge of the cliff where I stand.  I try
to take a picture, but my camera battery is dead.  Fuck me.  Wait!  I realize the camera must be dead because of the
cold.  I cup it in my hands to try to warm it and...IT WORKS!!!  This must have been what happened to my Kindle, too.
I'll try to revive that later when we reach the next camp (it doesn't end up working).

![Whoa! We're high!](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0442.JPG)

We make way for Third Cave Camp, which is actually at a lower altitude - approximately 3800m.  The hike is easy.  It's 
mostly flat or downhill.  We cross the "Saddle" between Mawenzi and Kibo staying largely in the moorland region.  We 
reach Third Cave Camp by lunch and just hang out and relax and recover.

![Crossing the Saddle](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0456.JPG)

We come to find that the other groups won't be joining us.  They're following the traditional Rongai route - a 6-day 
climb which is less likely to succeed due to less acclimation.  As such, they've left Tarn Hut to head straight to 
School Hut at base of Kibo where they'll make their final ascent from.  It's our next stop, tomorrow, too.  We never 
find out if they were successful or not.  

![Part of a 2008 plane wreck on Kilimanjaro](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0450.JPG)

*[TK Update](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-4a/):* Day 4 of our trek 
and we are heading now to Third Cave. both climbers are doing very well.

##Day 5
![Leading the way](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0488.JPG)

On Day 5, we hike climb approximately 1100m to School Hut (at 4800m - well above almost all the clouds) by lunch.  We 
came up through what feels like an old riverbed or lava- or glacier flow.  We also pass a buffalo carcass that has 
been there for 3-4 years by our assistant guide's, Ismaili Mohamed, estimation.  The dry, thin air and lack of flora 
and fauna has preserved the carcass remarkably well.  It still stinks though. Also, it's horns are missing - do the 
horns at Tarn Hut belong to this buffalo?

![Buffalo carcass](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0489.JPG)

After lunch, we prep for our impending summit try.  We pull out all the cold weather gear we have to change into 
after dinner/before bed.  We pack everything else into one bag so that all we need to do upon waking is throw a few 
things in a duffel.  We have dinner - at this point it is just carbs and vegetables to carbo-load for summit and 
because [bodies don't process protein at altitude as well as carbs](https://www.wms.org/news/altitude.asp).  We 
realize they've been phasing protein out of our meals as we've progressed.

![At School Hut with our guides Ismaili and Thomas](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0502.JPG)

We're sent to bed at approximately 1900.  We're only slated to get, at most, 4.5 hours of sleep.  Day 6 really starts
today.  I wake up multiple times.  Once due to the rain that's coating our tent in a layer of ice.  And once due to 
anxiousness.

![View of camp at School Hut](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0508.JPG)

*[TK Updates](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-5a/):* We are now heading
 to School and both climbers are doing fine with a nice weather on our side.
*[TK Update 2](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-5a-2/):* We arrived at 
School Hut safe and well. We are on preparation for our summit attempt tonight. Everything is well organized.

##Day 6
We're called out of our warm sleeping bags and tent at 2300 on Day 5.  We eat "breakfast" at 2330.  More carbs and 
vegetables.

![About to make our push!](/images/kilimanjaro/20151004181134-1.jpg)

Our summit attempt is a 7.5km hike through the middle of the night.  It's very dark.  Our guides don't use 
headlamps. I'm not sure if this is because they know the trail _that well_, or if it's because Mrs' headlamp is 
bright enough for everyone.

We move at a pretty quick pace.  I take off my snow pants because

0. they're bulky; and
0. they're hot

I'll come to regret it.

After scrambling over really bouldery terrain, we reach the point where our route joins the Marangu route 
- a set of never-ending switchbacks up a plain of scree that ends at the crater rim.  It looks like there are only 2
groups ahead of us.  We're quickly catching one of them.  Or are they descending?!  If they're descending, that's 
going to be a huge morality hit.  We end up catching them.  They aren't descending - just momving very slowly.  

I realize I should have brought a flask of whiskey and joke about it to the guides.  They joke back that champagne 
would be a better celebratory drink.  Jokes keep the morale up.  

Mrs keeps stopping/starting.  It's starting to hurt.  My legs are getting cold (see, I regret taking off my ski 
pants) every time we stop.  And we seem to stop every time I get in a rhythm.  My feet and hands are cold also.  I 
resolve to buy really expensive gloves when we get home.  I'd always wondered, _Who spends $250 on gloves?_ when I 
saw them on the rack at REI, The North Face, or the like.  Well, now I will.

We reach Gillman's Point (5,681m/18,638ft) 1.5 hours ahead of schedule.  Holy Shit.  We made it!  A round of 
congratuations, high-fives, and hugs.  Wait, what do you mean we have another 1.5 hours to Uhuru Peak?!  So, we didn't
actually make it?  Ugh, soldier on.

![View of Mawenzi behind the crater at the center of Kibo](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0512.JPG)

As we walk along the rim, I pause frequently to take in my surroundings.  It looks otherworldly.  Like we were 
plucked from Earth and dropped on some far-off planet.  Everything is draped in shades of pink, purple, white, grey 
and black.  

![Looking across Kibo](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0514.JPG)

As we walk along the rim, I pause frequently because my legs are getting tired and cramped.  A couple of narrow 
paths and squeeze points make me realize that the only thing separating me from the crater floor hundres of feet 
below is a small misstep.  

It's cold.  Very cold.  I'm colder than I've ever been in my life.  So cold that my Camelbak has frozen despite 
blowing the water back through the straw into the reservoir after every pull.  I get a pull from Mrs' Camelbak and 
Thomas hands my my Nalgene backup from his bag.  He graciously carried any extra weight I could spare.  He and 
Ismaili have been such great guides.  We pass another group where a woman is practically buing carried by her 
guide/porter.  She does not look good.

The glaciers that looked like just a dusting of snow on the peak are MASSIVE!  They're stories tall, and could cover 
multiple football fields.  I'm shocked at how deceiving they looked from far below.

![Glaciers - with people in the foreground for scale](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0515.JPG)

What's that?  Is that?!  WE ACTUALLY MADE IT!!!?!?!?!  Hurry, let's take some pictures and get out of here.  It's 
freezing.  Camera is dead.  FUCK MY GODDAMN LIFE!!!  Warm it up by breathing on it and snap a couple of quick photos 
that don't do what I'm witnessing justice. 

![At the top](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0518.JPG)

We set off back down.  What took 7 hours to climb, should only take 2-2.5 to descend.  On the way down, I get to try 
my hand at "Tanzanian skiing" on the way down to bypass the switchbacks.  My legs are killing me as they're 
developing serious cramps.  I have not been drinking enough water.  I slow the group down and we reach lunch point 
Kibo Hut (4,730 m/15,520 ft) late.

![Mawenzi on the way down](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0521.JPG)

We ask porters to set our tent so we can take a quick nap.  Once I lay down, I don't think I'm going to get back up. 
We manage to get up to eat lunch - more fried potatoes - then scamper back to tent to sleep some more. Ismaili 
immediately comes to get us and says we've got to hike another 6km/3 hours to the next camp to end the day.

![Crossing the Saddle (again)](/images/kilimanjaro/IMG_0529.JPG)

It's mostly downhill as we cross the Saddle again, heading down the other side of Kilimanjaro.  On the way down we 
pass the medical evacuation point and a number of stretcher carts on the way.  I contemplate climbing into one and 
waiting for someone to push me down the rest of the way to Horombo Hut (3,760 m/12,340 ft) for our last night on the 
mountain.

*[TK Update 1](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-6a/):* Both climbers are
ready to attack the summit. They are both happy and excited.
*[TK Update 2](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-6a-summit/):* We arrived
at the summit safe and well, both climbers feel great and happy for reaching the highest point of Africa.


##Day 7
Wake up early, again, feeling refreshed.  We've got 19km to cover - all of which is downhill.  The day starts with 
the team singing us some songs in Swahili and wishing us well.  We formally thank them for all their hard work.  

Honestly, we couldn't have made it without them.  Everyone of the Team Kilimanjaro team: from our guides, Thomas Jonas, 
Ismaili Mohamed, the cook, Shukuru "Baraka Obama" Lumas, the senior porters, Damas Masawe, Antelimu Oiso, the toilet 
porter (and yes, Mrs was thrilled to have her own, private bathroom on the mountain), Artas Richad, and the rest of 
the crew: Lorgard Shayo, Yona Wilamu, Abubakari Bega, Jeams Denis, and Hismaeli Rafeal.  The do this over, and over, 
and over like some sort of super humans climbing the mountain nearly twice as fast as us and doing everything in 
their power to make sure we reached the top and made our goal.  They were awesome.  And our planning agent Ally, who 
we bombarded with questions and managed to arrange everything perfectly from the time we landed at Kilimanjaro airport 
until we were safely at the third leg of our trip, Pemba Island.  _**Thanks to all of them.**_

![The crew](/images/kilimanjaro/20151005034055.jpg)

On the way down, we encounter climbers moving in the other direction.  They look fresh and enthusiastic.  I chuckle 
thinking that they have no idea what's about to hit them.  Then I realize that I must look ragged.  Maybe I'm their 
reminder.  We exchange "Jumbo," the now-familiar Swahili word for "Hi," and enthusiastically wish them luck and 
encourage them on as we pass.  Reaching the peak was so cool - I hope they make it.

We descend fast.  We're out of the bushland and into the forest in no time.  On the way down, we get up and close 
with a troop of Blue monkeys and glimpse another troop of Colobus monkeys in the tree tops.    

As we move further down, we pass some day hikers heading to the Maundi Crater (2,780 m/9,120 ft).  As we pass, I can 
understand enough of their broken English to hear them react to their guide's comment that we're on our way down from
the peak - like my sense of accomplishment could be any more inflated right now.  We reach Marangu Gate by lunch and 
couldn't be happier to see a car.

![Back at Marangu Gate](/images/kilimanjaro/20151005034058.jpg)

As we drive away, heading back to Onsea House in Arusha to rest, I can't stop looking at the mountain.  It was  
overcast on the drive to Kilimanjaro.  Heading away, the sky is clear and the mountain absolutely envelopes my entire
view, periphery to periphery.  It's awe inspiring reflecting back, thinking that _we stood at the top of that_.  
There's nothing Mrs and I can't do.

![Received our certificates back at Onsea House](/images/kilimanjaro/20151005055037.jpg)

With the mountain behind us, as well as any doubt that Mrs and I are the perfect team in all things, we shower for 
the first time in 7 days and, O.M.G., is it glorious.  We optimally repack for our early morning tomorrow - we're off
to [safari in the Serengeti](/safari).

*[TK Update 1](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-7a/):* Final day of our 
team at the mountain and both climbers are doing fine. We are moving to the exit gate of the mountain today.

*[TK Update 2](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-7b/):* We are at Mandara
Hut and both climbers are still in good shape. We are still on the way to the exit gate of the mountain.

*[TK Update 3](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-7c/):* Our trek ended 
today and both climbers feel great and happy for their achievements. We are now signing out and on the way to Arusha.

*[TK Update 4](https://teamkilimanjaro.com/blog/jala-x-2-29th-september-5th-october-2015-day-7d/):* We are back at 
the hotel and summit certificate from Team Kilimanjaro was given for both of them. They are very and happy proud for
the success of their climb at Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest free standing mountain in the world.
