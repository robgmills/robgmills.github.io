## Universal Principles of Influence
### Law of Reciprocation
* I am obligated to give back to you the form of behavior that you first give to me (Dr Robert Cialidini?)
* Is it ethichal to do something for someone and then call it later?
    * yes, necessary for society to function
    * Future obligation for repayment of favors gives ua group a tremendous cometitive advantage
* Don't fumble this; stay until all stories are done; 
* If someone does you a favor, don't answer: "no problem" "just doing my job" or "it was nothing"
    * instead, "Absolutely, I know that if the situation were reversed, you'd do the same for me."
    * Don't give away the favor that they owe you back
    * reinforces the natural human tendency for reciprocation and natural self-belief that one is _good_
    * "Of course, I know it's important that this gets done;  I know that if I needed something you'd be there for me."
* If this is always happening, they may feel entitled
* Reciprocity works in negotiations too!
    * Do it right away.
    * "While you're here, I need _X_, do you think you can help me out?"

* *Always start with the larger request*
* Retreat back to what you were after all along
* We usually do the opposite - start with the smaller one.
* Give them a chance to say _Yes_
    * iF they do, great!
    * if they say no, fall back to more moderate request
* Need to come back with the more moderate request *right away!*
    * If you take time to think about it, it's perceived as a separate request and not as a concession as part of a negotiation

> If you retreat from the situation, you lose.  If you retreat in the sitiation, you win. 
> - Dr. R. Cialidini

### Motivated by scarcity
If you want to create a presuasive argument:
* You need to explain what it is about this that they can't get anywhere else
* Managers weigh information about ponetial losses more heavily than information about potential gains
* Tell them what they want to hear
* "Milage Runs" are a great example
    * Uber to Des Moines w/hotel, gas, red bull for driver less expensive than flight to des moines
* Scarcity works for information too
    
### Consensus
People are more likely to say yes when they see other people doing the same thing

* It helps to know where the resistence is coming from
* Example: we want to use this new javascript framework
    * Show consensus in the industry
    * *Google trends*

### Consistency
People live up to what they write down

* Present an idea, "so what do you all think about this"
    * first person to speak out is going to tip it one way or another
    * get osemone

### Authority
If an expert says it, it must be true!
* Realize that you are the expert.
* If you are paid to do something, you are an expert.
* Junior expert vs senior expert.
* You might be the most junior expert on a team of experts, but you are an expert on a team of experts and you should carry yourself as such.

Establishing expertise
* Background
* Trustworthiness
    * How do you show trustworthiness if they don't know you?
    * Lead with a weakness in your case
    * Hey I wish I had a perfect solution for you, all we do is the best with what we have, there's a real drawback to our approach, here it is
    * Establishes as knowledgable enough about the pros and cons *and* honest enough to bring the cons to the surface

### Being liked
People prefer to say yes to those they know and like

* similarities (peoplo who are like us)
* compliments (people who like us and say it)
* cooperative efforts (work with us toward a common goal)

You can't win an argument
* holy wars in tech industry
* tabs vs spaces
* microservices vs monolith
* java vs go

> A person convinced against their will, will be of the same opinion still.
> - Dale Carnegie

Persons in an argument leave more convinced they're right
* I'm even righter than I thought
