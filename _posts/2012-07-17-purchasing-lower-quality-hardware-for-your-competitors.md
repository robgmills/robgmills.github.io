[Purchasing lower quality hardware for your competitors](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem)

> We told HP we needed better displays [for the Pre 3]. They'd come back and say, â€˜Apple bought them all. Our suppliers tell us we need to build them a factory if we want the displays' and they weren't willing to put the billion dollars upfront to do that," one source said. "The same thing happened with cameras. We'd pick a part, turns out Apple picked the same part. We were screwed left and right.

Apple literally purchased their competitors into lower quality hardware.  That's just plain nuts.  I mean, I can see how its possible if you KNOW you have the demand - which Apple does given its legions of fans.  But still, that's just freaking nuts.  If you see a delay in high density displays making their way into other products, now you know why.
