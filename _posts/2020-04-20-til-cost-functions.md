I'm excited to have started [Andrew Ng's _Machine Learning_ class oun Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) over the weekend!
I hope to learn how to apply machine learning to my decision-making process to make better, more informed decisions.

I've only gone through the first few lectures which have reacquainted me with basic machine learning concepts:

* supervised vs unsupervised learning
* regression, classification, and clustering
* parameters, features, variables and labels
* linear algebra and matrix multiplication

But the biggest thing I've learned so far is what a _cost function_ is and why it is important.
A cost function is an algorithm that measures the accuracy of the algorithm in your model (otherwise know as your _hypothesis_).
This cost function is an important part of the learning process because it helps you quickly identify the optimal algorithm based on your training data.

The class went through building a linear regression algorithm that used a _mean squared error_ cost function to evaluate how using different function parameters affected the accuracy of the algorithm.
