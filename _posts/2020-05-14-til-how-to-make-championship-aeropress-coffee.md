Sheltering in place for COVID-19 has me making more coffee at home.
I've saved a boatload of money not paying for coffee (and usually an extra one for someone to keep me company).
But lately I haven't been satisfied with my craftsmanship.

I've tried [various methods and recipes](https://aeropress.com/use-it-now/getting-started/) that incorporated 

* changes to the vertical orientation of the Aeropress (a.k.a. [_The Inverted Method_](https://www.moustachecoffeeclub.com/aeropress-inverted-method-how-to-brew))
* the amount and granularity of the coffee grounds
* the amount of time to stir the coffee
* the amount of time to brew the coffee
* the amount and temperature of the water used (both during brewing and dilution)
* the number, thickness, or granularity of the coffee filters

My current iteration - based on the video above and the [2019 World Aeropress Champion Recipe](https://youtu.be/SEOOCkU01A8) - utilizes _The Inverted Method_, with 35g of coarsely ground coffee, brewed with 100 grams of 90&deg; Celcius water and diluted with 120 grams of 92&deg; Celcius water.

30+ grams of coffee seems like a lot - I'll probably experiment with [decreasing the amount of coffee and coarseness of the grind](https://knowyourgrinder.com/how-fine-to-grind-coffee-for-aeropress/) next.
