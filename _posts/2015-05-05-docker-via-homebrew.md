Docker is a great tool for getting lightweight, isolated Linux environments. It uses technology that doesn’t work natively on Macs. Until now you’ve had to boot into a VM to install and use Docker, but it’s now a little easier than that.

As of Docker 0.8 it can be run on Macs thanks to a specially developed, lightweight VirtualBox VM. There are official instructions for installing Docker on Mac, but with Homebrew and cask it’s even easier.

Follow the instructions on the cask homepage to install it. Cask is an extension to Homebrew for installing Mac binary packages via the command line. Think things like Chrome or Steam. Or VirtualBox. Running Docker on Mac requires VirtualBox so if you don’t have it already:

    brew cask install virtualbox


Then install Docker and the helper tool boot2docker:

    brew install docker
    brew install boot2docker


boot2docker takes care of the VM that Docker runs in. To get things started it needs to download the Docker VM and start a daemon that the docker command line tool will talk to:

    boot2docker init
    boot2docker up

The docker command line tool should now be able to talk to the daemon and if you run docker version you should see a report for both a server and a client. (Note: When I ran boot2docker up it told me that the default port the daemon uses was already taken. I had to specify a different port via the DOCKER_HOST environment variable, which I now set in my shell configuration.)

If everything has gone well to this point you should now be able to start up a Docker instance. This command will drop you into a bash shell in Ubuntu:

    docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

Use ctrl-D to exit. I find this especially helpful for very quickly getting to a Linux command line from my Mac for testing this or that, like checking what versions of software are installing by apt-get.
