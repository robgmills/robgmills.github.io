I'm a man driven by lists.
I keep a [Kanban][] board to help me manage my life.
Lists help me comprehend and prioritize both things to come and experiences past.
Some lists are fleeting, like a shopping list for the grocery store.
Others may live forever but constantly change to reflect what is most important to you at that time.

There are a few lists that I think are more important than others so I've decided to publish them. 

- [Companies that I'll always pick up the phone for (should they ever call) and colleagues (both present and former) that I'd actively seek out opportunities to work with.][companies-and-people]
- [My bucket list](/bucket-list/)
