![Portrait of Almon Brown Stowger (source: Wikipedia)](/images/2020/05/13/almon-brown-strowger.jpg)

Almon Brown Strowger was an undertaker in the late 19th century.
He discovered that he was losing clients because his competitor's wife, a telephone operator, was intercepting calls for his business and redirecting them to her husband's.

So what did he do?
He invented the [Strowger switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strowger_switch) and ushered in an age of automated telephone operators.
Imagine being so pissed off at someone that _you not only get them fired, **you remove their entire profession from existence.**_

And as an ultimate 19th century mic drop, with his revenge now complete, Strowger sold his patents and equity to his associates<sup>&dagger;</sup> and returned to being an undertaker in St. Petersburg, Florida.

____

<sup>&dagger;</sup> He sold his patents for $1800 in 1896.  Exactly 20 years later, those same patents sold for $2.5 million.  Adjusted for inflation, that's like getting $42,624 for a $59,200,00 asset today.
