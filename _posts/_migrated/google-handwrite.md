Whoa. Google just launched a writing feature implemented in all HTML5/CSS3. Its called [Handwrite](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/handwritinginput/mobile.html). It allows you to write anywhere on the screen and it inputs into the search box on Google's home page.

Its quick and responsive and just shows how powerful HTML5 and CSS3 are. I definitely think its the future of mobile development - write once, run anywhere. No more having to learn the nuances and intricacies of native languages.
