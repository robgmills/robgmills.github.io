> An interesting exchange took place on Thursday, March 22, at the Yamaha press conference in Jerez after the presentation of the freshly painted, new Yamaha M1s. Lorenzo was asked if he still believed, as he had said several times earlier, that the 1000cc bikes were too fast.

> "Yes," he said unhesitatingly, "I believe 360 km/h is too fast, but I don't make the rules. Mr. Ezpeleta is here. Let him answer."

Interesting indeed.  He's asking for a level playing field that makes it more about the rider than the bike.  New riders should take a lot away from that.  Instead of spending money to increase the performance metrics of the bike - which realistically, most riders will never come close to reaching - use the time and money to increase your skills.
