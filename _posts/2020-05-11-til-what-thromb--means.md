> **thromb-** combining form. (Pathology) indicating a blood clot: thromboembolism. [from Greek thrombos lump, clot]

I've recently come across enough words beginning with the prefix _thromb-_ or _thrombo-_ to trigger my curiousity and seek out the origins.

Examples include:

* **thrombosis:**  just a regular old blood clot
* **thromboembolism:** a blood clot that became dislodged from another point in the circulatory system and is now blocking circulation
* **thrombocytopenia:** when you have low platlet counts (meaning the inability to clot?)

I would have figured that one of the reasons _thromb-_ was prevalent was due to the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic which has caused a lot of respiratory issues for folks.  But I can't seem to find any _thromb-_ words relating to the lungs.
