I keep a list of companies that I'd like to work for, and people that I'd like to work with (in some cases, I already am).
Keeping this list helps me focus my career in the right direction.
The companies are all doing really interesting work and/or have exemplary engineering cultures.
The people are all prideful workers. 
Neither list is in any sort of order, and they change over time as my life experiences shape my priorities.
