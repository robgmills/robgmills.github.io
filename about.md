# Professional Button Pusher
I sit in front of a screen and push buttons attached to a computer to make things that people find useful.
By trade, I've served as a Software Engineer, Architect, Engineering Manager and now Director.
I enjoy shepherding the mixture of people, process and technology to solve complex business problems at scale.
I've built mobile applications and websites, e-commerce websites, enterprise integration applications, business support software, REST APIs and SOAP web services; teams, career plans and ladders, and business and technical strategies.
While my professional experience has been in a predominately Java-based stack, I love solutions built in any language.
 
Some of my current favorite things are:

- [Bash][] (I do a lot of scipting as a manager)
- [Kafka][] and stream processing systems 
- [Kubernetes][] and distributed architectures
- [Docker][]
- [AWS][]

And I'm learning more and more about data science and analytics.

# Rocketman
I love riding motorcycles.
So much so, that, on my spare weekends in the summer, I used to teach beginners how to ride at [RideChicago][] motorcycle school.
I'll ride anything with two wheels, but my garage currently houses a 2014 Ducati Hypermotard and (my wife's) 2016 Ducati Scrambler.
I'm also rebuilding a 2005 Husqvarna SMR450.
Despite the stereotype, I'm a safety nut.
I try to be a positive ambassador for the entire motorcycle community.

# Sometimes, Philosopher
I like to think about things.
Big things.
Like whether evil is required for good to exist.
Or where the line between insanity and genius lies.
Or what comprises a good person.
And definitely about what defines a fulfilled life.
I believe that life makes it too easy to get lost in the details.
And that by making a conscience effort to consider these existential questions, I make sure that my presence on this world is a positive one - for me and those that I come in contact with.
