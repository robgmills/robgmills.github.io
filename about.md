# Professional Button Pusher
I sit in front of a screen and push buttons attached to a computer to make things
that people find useful. By trade, I've served as a Software Engineer, Architect, 
and now Development Manager.  I've built mobile applications and websites, 
e-commerce websites, enterprise integration applications, business support 
software, REST APIs and SOAP web services.  While my professional experience has 
been in a predominately Java-based stack, I love solutions built in any language.
 
Some of my current favorite things are:

- [Elastic][]
- [Kafka][]
- [Camel][]
- [Karaf][]
- [Zookeeper][]
- [MongoDB][]
- [Cassandra][]
- [Mesos][]
- [Docker][]
- [Spring Boot][]
- [Spring MVC][]
- [Spring Data][]
- [Spring Data Rest][]
- [Spring Security][]
- [Spring Security OAuth][]
- [Ruby on Rails][]
- [Sass][]/[Compass][]
- [AngularJS][]
- [BackboneJS][]

# Rocketman
I love riding motorcycles.  So much so, that, on my spare weekends in the summer, I 
teach beginners how to ride at [RideChicago][] motorcycle school. I'll ride 
anything with two wheels, but my garage currently houses a 2003 Honda CBR600RR and 
a 2005 Husqvarna SMR450.  Despite the stereotype, I'm a safety nut.  I try to be a 
positive ambassador for the entire motorcycle community.

# Sometimes, Philosopher
I like to think about things.  Big things.  Like whether evil is required for good 
to exist.  Or where the line between insanity and genius lies.  Or what comprises 
a good person.  And definitely about what defines a fulfilled life.  I believe that 
life makes it too easy to get lost in the details.  And that by making a conscience 
effort to consider these existential questions, I make sure that my presence on 
this world is a positive one - for me and those that I come in contact with.
